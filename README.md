# HTML-CSS Refactor
This is my first HTML-CSS debugging challenge.

My first attempt to solve it did not include proper uses of semantic HTML elements. There were also superflous CSS selectors and properties that weren't fully consolidated. This repo was named "challenge-1" instead of a more unique alternative based on what the application is trying to achieve. And I didn't provide multiple commits with proper messages, so the final one consists of all the updates I made while solving this challenge.

To top things off, this file was also empty. So here's my attempt to fill it with useful information outlining my learnings. ðŸ˜‰

As specified in the Challenge Acceptance Criteria, the refactor includes the following:

âœ¨ Semantic HTML elements.

âœ¨ Elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

âœ¨ Accessible alt attributes.

âœ¨ Heading attributes that fall in sequential order.

âœ¨ A concise, descriptive title.

Below is a screenshot of my latest and greatest:
